# The Auditor Bot
It watches, and waits, and counts, and tallies, and eventually it will spout upon its subjects a great froth of useless information.
Counts:
- most prolific members
- most common words
- most common emojis
- most common reactions
- most reacted messages
- most sent gifs
- most active periods of time
- and more!

This is represented by a mixture of markdown styled text output and matplotlib graphs (styled).
Since this bot retrieves and analyses a lot of data all at once, expect it to take a long time!
